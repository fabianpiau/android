Android
=======

This repository contains all my Android apps. For now, there is only one...

* **CarmaBlog**  
This app is a good way to visit [my blog](http://blog.fabianpiau.com/) on Android devices.  
I decided to build this app for the course "[Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps](https://www.coursera.org/course/androidapps101)" available on Coursera. I wanted something useful, something that motivates me enough. So CarmaBlog App was born.
